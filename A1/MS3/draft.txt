Three clinic module/library functions have been completely 
supplied for you: "displayScheduleHeader", "displayScheduleData", 
and "menuAppointment", along with two function prototypes: "importPatients" 
and "importAppointments" (responsible for data import). 
These functions provide you with the necessary framework 
to get started in this final milestone.


Appointment Management
==============================
1) VIEW   ALL Appointments
2) VIEW   Appointments by DATE
3) ADD    Appointment
4) REMOVE Appointment
------------------------------
0) Previous menu
------------------------------
Selection: 


selection : 1
call viewAllAppointments()
viewAllAppointments{
at some point you need to call "displayScheduleHeader" and "displayScheduleData" functions

call displayScheduleTableHeader that receives two arguments
const struct Date* date and int isAllRecords (it should be 1 or true because this function is being called from inside the viewAllAppointments)

then in an iteration call displayScheduleData() that receives three args:
(const struct Patient* patient,
                         const struct Appointment* appoint,
                         int includeDateField)




}
